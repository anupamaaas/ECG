#Discrete Fourier Transform

The required ECG signal has been obtained from [Physionet.org](https://archive.physionet.org/cgi-bin/atm/ATM)

Observations from the output:
*	Plot 1 represents the given ECG signal and plot 2 represents the Magnitude of the Fast Fourier Transform of the ECG signal provided. 
* The Fourier transform is achieved through the inbuilt function ‘fft’.
*	The ECG signals demonstrate the latent operation of the heart and constitute events that concur and coexist with the succession of depolarization and repolarization of the atria and ventricles. 
*	Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to convert the ECG signal, i.e. in the time domain, to an ECG signal in the frequency domain for more accurate extraction of peak values.
