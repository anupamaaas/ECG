# Discrete Fourier Transform of ECG

Accurate detection of ECG signals is necessary to determine any cardiovascular abnormalities. The ECG signal consists of P, Q, R, S and T waves and each wave represents a function of the heart: 
* P-wave -> atrial depolarization 
* Q-wave -> depolarization of interventricular septum
* R-wave -> depolarization of ventricles 
* S-wave -> final depolarization of the ventricles


Fourier analysis (FA) is a method of **data analysis**. It seeks to simplify complex or noisy data by decomposing it into a series of trigonometric or exponential functions, such as sine waves. 
1)	DFT can calculate a signal's frequency spectrum. This is a direct examination of information encoded in the frequency, phase, and amplitude of the component sinusoids. 
2)	It can find a system's frequency response from the system's impulse response, and vice versa. This allows systems to be analyzed in the frequency domain. 
3)	DFT can be used as an intermediate step in more elaborate signal processing techniques.
